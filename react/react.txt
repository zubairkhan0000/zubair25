it is a library

it is used to develop single page application

it is a component based application
    components are reuseable 

react is decelrative

note:- react will renders component on the web page 
    without page reloading

how to create react application
-------------------------------
1)CDN
2)Node.js way
    a)npm
        used to install update delete packages in a js
        packages will be installed golobally
    npm install -g creact-react-app
    creact-react-app project-name

    npm creact vite@latest -->install latest version of react

    b)npx
        used to execute packages without installing it
        no need of golobally while installing packages
    npx create-react-app project-name

folder stucture of react
---------------------------
node-modules folder:-
    all the packages and third party library

src folder:-
    it is an main folder
    it is used for creating components

index.html file:-
    it is a root file

eslint(ecma script lint):-
    used for debug purpose

package.json file:-
    it store all dependency and third party library

    //babel
    will convert advance concept of js to old version

components in react
--------------------

components are basic building blocks in react
components are re-useable 

two-types
---------
1)class based component
2)function based component/presentational component/dumb component

class based component:-
    it is a es6 class in js
    it uses react life cycle
    is a stateful component
    uses render() method
        will renders component on the web page
    it uses constructor to store data and extends keyword

class demo extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return <h1> iam class based component</h1>
    }
}
export default demo;


function based component:-
    it is a js pure function
    it does not use react life cycle
    it does not take any rende() method
    it is a stateless
    after react 16.8 function based component becomes stateful component
    because of hooks.
    there is no constructor and extends in function based component

import React from 'react'
function demo1(){
    reutrn(
        <h1>function based class</h1>
    )
}
export default demo1;

import React from 'react'
let demo1=() =>{
    reutrn(
        <h1>function based class</h1>
    )
}
export default demo1;

ways of creaatimg elements
---------------------------

html
----

<h1>hello world</h1>

DOm in js
----------

let h1=document.createElement("h1)
console.log(h1)
h1.textContent="hello"

React
-----

React.createElement("tag-name","null or {id: 'demo"}","content")

eg:-
React.createElement("h1","null","hello")

eg:-
React.createElement("div",{id:"demo"},React.createElement("span","null","hello")

JSX(java-script XML)
--------------------
    it is used to react html in React
    it is neitherstring nor null

rules:-
    all elements should en-closed


props in react
--------------

props stand for properties
used to send data from one compoenent to another compoenent
props are uni-directional
props are immutable(read-only)

State in react
--------------
it used to store data in the component and update the data in the component

it is mutable(we can read and write)

Syntax:-
import {useState} from 'react'

let [state,setState]=useState(initial vlaue)

state--> used to store initial vlaue
setState--> used to update state value

ways of using styles in react
------------------------------
1)inline css
2)golobally css
3)externl.css

useRef hook in react
--------------------
-->ref stands for reference
-->useRef uses real-dom
-->useRef is having a object called current
-->uses ref keyword
-->useRef is used for the uncontrolled format

Syntax:-
import {useRef} form 'react'

let identifier=useRef()

note:-hooks were introduced in react 16.8
      hooks works only in FBC

List and keys in React
-------------------------

-->list is used to iterate array using map method
-->Keys are used to track an element 
-->using keys will understand which element is create updated and deleted

advantages:-
-->improves compoenent efficency
-->improves optimization of the browser

how to avoid props drilling
---------------------------
1)useContext hook
2)HDC(higher order component)
3)
useContext hook in react(IMP)
----------------------------
-->used to send data from one component to multiple component without passing/using props
-->it is used to avoid props drilling

Syntax:-
import React from create

step1:create a useContext and export it

export let/var/const identifier-name=React>createContext(initial-value)

step2: use provider to pass the vlaue
<identifier-name.provider>
    <Child compoenet/>
</identifier-name.provider>

step3: use consumer to consume value given by provider

<identifier-name.consumer>
    {
        cbf
    }
</identifier-name.consumer>

useEffect hook in react
-----------------------

it used to preovide side effect for function based component
in react we can tell to component to perform something after componenet renders

advantage of used effect

it is used fro updating a dom 
it is used for timer
it is used to fetch an api

useEffect will avoid react life cycle in cbc.
componetDigMount
componentDigUpdate
componentWillUnMount

Syntax:-
import {useEffect} from 'react'

useEffect(cbf,dependency)

dependency(3-ways)
    1)no dependency-->will renders infinte
    2)empty dependency-->component will render only once
    3)dependency with value(state,props)-->only when the value changes

Browser Routers in reract
-------------------------

it is a library
it used to interact one compoenent to multiple component
is a pre defined componenet used to wrap route
is a pre defined componenet used for routing purpose
browser router is a pre defined compoenent used to wrap routes 
useNavigate() it is used to navigate component
useParmes() hooks it is used to target pre defined variable
<Link></Link> used for linking purpose
<outlet></outlet> used for place holder
